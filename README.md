# Tech Blog

## Description

The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site, similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. This site follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

The blog provides a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly interface where developers can sign up, log in, publish their thoughts and ideas, comment on existing posts, and manage their posts via a personal dashboard.

This application is deployed on Heroku.
